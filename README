Meet Vertexer, a simple 3D grid with which you can place paths in: 
3D. 

Vertexer has vim-like controls and functionality. This means that
to insert paths you enter INSERT mode, in which the mouse is stuck 
to an insertion plane that can be dynamically moved up and down as
you add vertices to your path. To view your path from different
angles/perspectives you enter VISUAL mode, which has controls that
resemble a first person shooter. You can look around with the
mouse while moving forwards/backwards and strafing up or sideways
using the keyboard. In the DEFAULT mode you can freely select
paths with the mouse and subsequently rename, restyle or delete
them. Finally, commands are entered in COMMAND mode, a terminal-
like prompt.

Vertexer interfaces with POV-ray using the functions in
toolshed.py to generate a .pov file.

The command :h in vertexer presents the help menu. Alternatively,
refer to the files HELPTXT1 and HELPTXT2.
